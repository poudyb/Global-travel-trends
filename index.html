                Out of the top 25 tourist destinations, there has been a rapid and steady increase,
                with notable dips in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks and in the 2008 financial crisis.
                Why has international tourism increased so rapidly?

                In South Korea, the government has made a concerted effort to export its culture
                and attract tourists. Inbound tourism grew 450% from 1995 to 2018.

                The United States of America is another top travel destination where tourism has
                almost doubled to roughly 80 million visitors in 2018 as compared to the number 
                of visitors in 1996. 
                <br>
                <br> The tourism pattern in USA over the past 25 years also tells a compelling story about the 
                impact government investments and regulations can have on a country's tourism industry. 
                <br>
                <br>In 1997 Congress dissolved the United States Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) which 
                operated the country's official travel and tourism offices worldwide and promoted United States
                as a tourist destination to international travelers. While the tourism industry saw some decrease
                in tourism following the dissolvement of USTTA, it picked up soon after. 
                <br>
                <br>The travel and tourism industry in the United States got heavily impacted due to the September 11
                attacks. Tourism within and to the United States fell steadily in the year and a half following the
                9/11 attacks. In the first full week after flights resumed, passenger numbers fell by nearly 45 percent,
                from 9 million in the week before September 11 to 5 million. In an effort to boost the severely impacted 
                tourism industry, in 2003, Congress restarted funding for travel promotion through the Consolidated 
                Appropriations Resolution and established the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board (USTTAB), which has
                been re-chartered several times, most recently in September 2013. 
                <br>
                <br>The next dip in tourism happened in 2009 after the US financial crisis in 2008. While this drop was 
                considerably milder than what had occurred after the 9/11 attacks, 250,000 jobs were lost purely in 
                the tourism industry. Travel prices also fell twice as fast in the 2008 recession as they did after 
                the 9/11 attacks. Presumably to cope up with the decline in tourism and the corresponding economic 
                impact, US Federal Government and Lawmakers established a public-private entity in 2009 to promote 
                U.S. tourism, the Corporation for Trade Promotion, which does business as Brand USA. Brand USA, which
                began operations in 2011, attributes 4.3 million incremental international visitors since 2013 to its 
                marketing efforts. 
                <br>
                <br>Tourism again experienced slight decrease following 2017. Industry experts say that two key factors
                were behind the decline in U.S. tourism: the strong dollar and controversial policies on immigration
                and travel introduced by President Trump's administration.
