                Out of the top 25 tourist destinations, there has been a rapid and steady increase,
                with notable dips in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks and in the 2008 financial crisis.
                Why has international tourism increased so rapidly?

                In South Korea, the government has made a concerted effort to export its culture
                and attract tourists. Inbound tourism grew 450% from 1995 to 2018.
                Given its current status as an entertainment export powerhouse, with the global
                “K-pop” phenomenon driving a >$5 billion Korean music industry today and Korean
                films raking in awards like the Oscar for Best Picture, Korea also tells a compelling
                story about the impact government spending and cultural exports can have on a
                country’s tourism industry. It also provides an informative view on the type of impact
                epidemics can have on tourism locally, based on its 2015 MERS epidemic. This is a potential
                hint of what the world may face during the COVID pandemic.
